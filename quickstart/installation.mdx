## Prerequisites
Compass only requires that it must be added by an administrator to a server that isn't blacklisted from the service.

## Installation Process
<Steps>
  <Step title="Adding Compass">
    [Authorise Compass](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1305462279906656267&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) and select the server to add it to. You need to be an Administrator or the owner of the server you add Compass to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Changing Settings">
    Once Compass joins your server, start by running `/config` and change the default settings to something that fits your community better. See **Configuration** for more details.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Using Plugins">
    After you finished setting up Compass, you can select plugins to enable/disable and configure from the `/config` command.
  </Step>
    <Step title="What Now?">
    Now Compass is fully set up in your server! If you want to use more advanced settings, look at the [reference](/reference/) or join the [support server](https://discord.gg/S2NZapJhEA) for additional resources.
